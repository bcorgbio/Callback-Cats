# Methods

All images of the Lepidoptera were pulled from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), a clearing house of collections and species information. GBIF have created an R package, [rgif](https://www.gbif.org/tool/81747/rgbif), that allows access to GBIFâ€™s application programming interface (API).This packages allows their records to be searchable from the command line.

```{r, message = FALSE}
library(rgbif) 
```

### Digitization

### Shape analysis

### Comparative analysis

### Evolutionary rates
