# Introduction
The importance of studying wing morphology (whether that be the size, shape, or pigmentation) is that it can aid in the study of taxonomy and evolution across lepidoptera. Past research articles, including @Strauss1990patterns, have shown morphometric variation in forewing and hindwing, specifically in studies on heliconia and ithomiine butterflies. Similar to this research study, we began by digitizing the wings along a metric scale bar. Aerodynamic constraints are one possible reason suggesting greater variability in shape differences from anterior to posterior along the wing. These aerodynamic factors include wing load and muscle development. Another study, @Owens2020comparative, showed that for swallowtails, the forewing shape and size showed stronger phylogenetic signals but evolved more slowly than the respective measures for the hindwing. This study suggested that forewings and hindwings have evolved independently from each other. The different selective pressures may be due to stabilizing selection imposed by dependence on forewings for flight, mimicry, and predation interactions.

We seek to answer three specific questions pertaining to wing-shape evolution across the lepidoptera, an order that includes species from both moths and butterflies. First, do fore- and hindwings vary in their evolutionary rates? Second, does the evolvability of the hind- and forewings vary significantly among major lineages of the lepidoptera? Finally, is there any correlation in forewing and hindwing shape? Our investigation implemented a morphometric approach, in which the wing shape outlines of around 200 Lepidoptera species were characerized.

# Methods



#### Image acquisition

All images of the Lepidoptera were pulled from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), a clearing house of collections and species information. GBIF have created an R package, [rgif](https://www.gbif.org/tool/81747/rgbif), that allows access to GBIF’s application programming interface (API).This packages allows their records to be searchable from the command line.

```{r, message = FALSE}
library(rgbif) 
```

#### Digitization

Roughly 200 species of Lepidoptera

#### Shape analysis

#### Comparative analysis

#### Evolutionary rates

#### Shifts in evolutionary rates

Analysis of fore- and hindwing PC1 shows that they are correlated. The p-value is very close to zero, indicating a significant relationship. Additionally, the R-squared value is 0.44. However, fore- and hindwing PC2s are not correlated. The p-value is 0.4121 and the R-squared value is very low. 


# Discussion
The Lepidoptera play an important role in terrestrial ecosystems, and use paired wings to fly in search of places to eat, reproduce, etc. These paired wings consist of a forewing and a hindwing that consequently have their own evolutionary rates. It has been sugguested that forewing shape and size may be the result of stabilizing selection due to the physical requirements of flight, and hindwing shape is due to differential survival and reproduction of individuals due to differences in phenotype (Sourakov 2013, Barber et al. 2015, Willmott et al. 2017, Rubin et al. 2018, Chazot et al. 2016)

By comparing PC1 values, the difference in the rates of wing-shape evolution showed hindwing values were about 0.0036 higher than forewing PC1. In PC2, the difference was about 0.0163 where hindwings were also higher. In a previous study (@Owens2020comparative), it was deduced that the phylogenetic signal is stronger in the forewing compared to the hindwing. This was demonstrated by much higher hindwing shape variation compared with forewings in ithomiine and heliconiine butterflies. In our study, the Macroheterocera clade, specifically the Noctuoidea family, underwent the most significant shift in evolutionary rate, with a slowdown of -0.00194 units. Furthermore, analysis of forewing and hindwing PC1 shows correlation as the p- and R-squared values indicate a significant relationship. The R-squared here shows that close to half of the trend in PC1 values can be explained by the line plotted in Figure 1. However, forewing and hindwing PC2s are not correlated because the p-value is 0.4121 and R-squared value is very low…
