# Introduction
The force produced by the contractions of skeletal muscle allows for movement and stabilization of joints, among other functions. Muscle generation of tension, or force, is based on the speed and length of the muscle. In particular, sliding filament theory posits that sarcomeres produce force by forming cross-bridges, protein complexes formed from the binding of overlapping actin and myosin. This means that greater cross-bridge formation leads to greater force production. It can then be inferred that sarcomere maximal isometric force is determined by the amount of actin-myosin overlap, which changes with muscle fiber length and implies an optimal length for maximal force production (Fig. 1). In this project, the force-length relationship is studied using human forearm flexors, with muscle length manipulated by altering elbow angle. We can then investigate the effect of muscle fiber length on force generation, as well as how the FL relationship is impacted by fatigue.

A previous study (@Sharma2020angles), observed the FL relationship by measuring maximum isometric contraction in the forearm over a range of elbow angles, finding that maximal force production occurred at an intermediate elbow angle of 90°. @Muanjai2020knee examined knee extensor isometric maximal voluntary contractions (MVCs) at various angles before and after eccentric exercise, finding a loss of force after exercise. Though the authors attribute the force decrease to a deficit in excitation-contraction coupling, it is clear that fatigue has an effect on force production.

We seek to construct isometric force-angle curves for forearm flexor MVCs at a number of elbow angles. The angle (θmax) at which non-fatigued (control) maximum isometric force occurs will be compared to the θmax of fatigued MVCs. The data collected here will help us to answer if isometric MVCs from different subjects coalesce around a typical FL relationship, and if θmax differs significantly between control and fatigue FL relationships.
