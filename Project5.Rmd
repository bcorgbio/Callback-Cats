# Introduction

Thermoregulation is the ability of an organism to regulate their temperature within certain parameters. Internal thermoregulation is known as homeostasis which ia a dynamic stability that plays an important role during physical exercise and periods of rest. When human subjects increase their activity from sedentary to active, there is an increase in body temperature due to an increase in metabolic heat production. The previous study, “Human Thermoregulation and Measurement of Body Temperature in Exercise and Clinical Settings,”
